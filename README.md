Premature optimization talk at ACCU 2015

A mysterious document, passed on by the Egyptians to Europeans via the Azteks,
talks about an ancient algorithm that can be used to derive the One Number To
Rule Them All. The algorithm needs to be run on a set of twelve books. We
have one of these books in our posession, the smallest one of the twelve.

The ancient document gave us an algorithm and some rudimentary unit tests for
it, but it looks like it's too slow to actually use. On this small book the
execution time is acceptable, but we suspect we'll run into problems when
running it on longer texts.

Make it go faster.
